    "# ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project to use the characteristics of bulldozers to predict their sale price.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inputs:** Bulldozer characteristics such as make year, base model, model series, state of sale (e.g. which state was it sold in), drive system and more.\n",
    "* **Outputs:** Bulldozer sale price (in USD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a **regression problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques used in here have been inspired and adapted from [the fast.ai machine learning course](https://course18.fast.ai/ml)."

    "### 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For this dataset, the problem we're trying to solve, or better, the question we're trying to answer is,\n",
    "\n",
    "> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data), you can you it's a time series problem. This means there's a time attribute to dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it's historical sales data of bulldozers. Including things like, model type, size, sale date and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples up to 2011 (close to 400,000 examples with 50+ different attributes, including `SalePrice` which is the **target variable**).\n",
    "2. **Valid.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples from January 1 2012 to April 30 2012 (close to 12,000 examples with the same attributes as **Train.csv**).\n",
    "3. **Test.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples from May 1 2012 to November 2012 (close to 12,000 examples but missing the `SalePrice` attribute, as this is what we'll be trying to predict).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** You can download the dataset `bluebook-for-bulldozers` dataset directly from Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, [Kaggle has set the evaluation metric to being root mean squared log error (RMSLE)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation). As with many regression evaluations, the goal will be to get this value as low as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how well our model is doing, we'll calculate the RMSLE and then compare our results to others on the [Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/leaderboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Features are different parts of the data. During this step, you'll want to start finding out what you can about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common ways to do this is to create a **data dictionary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this dataset, Kaggle provides a data dictionary which contains information about what each attribute of the dataset means. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable Name | Description  | Variable |\n",
    "|------|-----|-----|\n",
    "| SalesID   | unique identifier of a particular sale of a machine at auction  | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| MachineID  | identifier for a particular machine; machines may have multiple sales  | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| ModelID | identifier for a unique machine model (i.e. fiModelDesc) | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| datasource  | source of the sale record; some sources are more diligent about reporting attributes of the machine than others. Note that a particular datasource may report on multiple auctioneerIDs. | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| auctioneerID  | identifier of a particular auctioneer, i.e. company that sold the machine at auction. Not the same as datasource.  | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| YearMade  | year of manufacturer of the Machine  | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| MachineHoursCurrentMeter | current usage of the machine in hours at time of sale (saledate); null or 0 means no hours have been reported for that sale | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| UsageBand | value (low, medium, high) calculated comparing this particular Machine-Sale hours to average usage for the fiBaseModel; e.g. 'Low' means this machine has fewer hours given its lifespan relative to the average of fiBaseModel. | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| Saledate   | time of sale | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| fiModelDesc  | Description of a unique machine model (see ModelID); concatenation of fiBaseModel & fiSecondaryDesc & fiModelSeries & fiModelDescriptor  | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| State | US State in which sale occurred | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| Drive_System | machine configuration; typically describes whether 2 or 4 wheel drive  | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| Enclosure  | machine configuration - does the machine have an enclosed cab or not | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| Forks  | machine configuration - attachment used for lifting  | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| Pad_Type | machine configuration - type of treads a crawler machine uses | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| Ride_Control  | machine configuration - optional feature on loaders to make the ride smoother | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| Transmission | machine configuration - describes type of transmission; typically automatic or manual | Independent  variable |\n",
    "| ... | ... | ... |\n",
    "| SalePrice | cost of sale in USD | Target/dependent variable | \n",

    "\n",
    "With all of this being known, let's get started! \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll import the dataset and start exploring. Since we know the evaluation metric we're trying to minimise, our first goal will be building a baseline model and seeing how it stacks up against the competition."
